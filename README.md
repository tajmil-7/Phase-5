🚧 Urban Planning and Design Using AI and Data Analytics
This project focuses on improving urban planning through AI-driven insights and data visualization. By analyzing spatial, demographic, and mobility data, the system helps city planners make informed decisions to optimize land use, infrastructure, and public services for sustainable and smart cities.

📌 Features
🗺️ Land use classification and zoning recommendations using AI
📉 Data-driven analysis of population density, traffic, and amenities
🏙️ 3D visualization of urban growth and infrastructure layout
🌿 Environmental impact estimation and green space planning
📊 Dashboard for real-time urban analytics and planning support

🔧 Technologies Used
Python
QGIS / GeoPandas / Shapely (for geospatial analysis)
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for ML models)
Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
Flask / Streamlit (for web dashboard)
PostGIS / MongoDB (for spatial and planning data storage)

🏗️ How It Works

Data Collection: Ingest geospatial, census, mobility, and infrastructure data.

Analysis & Prediction: Use ML to detect patterns in urban sprawl, traffic, and land use.

Planning Suggestions: Generate optimal zoning and infrastructure layouts.

Visualization: Display interactive maps and simulations for planner insights.

Decision Support: Provide data-backed suggestions to urban authorities and stakeholders.
